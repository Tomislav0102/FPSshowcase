ENEMIES AI %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- idle behaviour look around - use animations, not transform.rotate
- attack behaviour is too simple - add cover, throwing grenades etc...

- probably need new BaseState - GoToDestination. When in search state looses target (or in attack state and target dies), enemy needs to return to starting position and then resume startState.

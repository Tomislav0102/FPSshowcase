ENEMIES AI %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- eventually get rid of all mixamo animations

- attack behaviour is too simple - add cover, throwing grenades etc...

- Pistol animations - animation rigging (left hand grabbing weapon) needs to be removed on some anmation

- Look around anim - problem when target is facing enemy and he is turning his head the other way

NOTES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

- players collider radius has been decreased - maybe that will create bugs

- throwing grenades - executes when enemy looses sight of player. Only one grenade is throw. Bool that governs that resets when exiting attack state
